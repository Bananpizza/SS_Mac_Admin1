## Where are we heading?

This is a fresh blog about things related to macOS of things in enterprise environments. I will try to add stuff for iPhones and iPads as well and don't be surprised if Android might appear when talking about phones.

There's some posts in the making that I hope will help you out there manage your Macs in an easy way or just expand your knowledge. Some posts will be technical, some posts will be pure information and some will be general thoughts and processes and some focusing on security.

## What's to come

Some posts I have in the vault are;

- Review of the Apple event 7th of September (if there is anything that's relevant)
- Single script Intune onboarding
- Microsoft Defender and macOS
- Apple sustainability and environment
- CIS Bench your macs in Intune
- Onboarding softwares
- Evaluation of the major endpoint management solutions


I hope there's some things here that might interest you!
