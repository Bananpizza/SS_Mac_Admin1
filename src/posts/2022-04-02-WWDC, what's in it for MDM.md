Apple's WWDC 2022 gave us quite some tings to have in mind going through the year. Both with macOS 13 (Ventura) and iOS and iPadOS 16. <br/>
Let's have a look and see what delicious features they are providing, some might have the potential to be disruptive, some might not. <br/><br/>




## Let's start with hardware limitations for macOS Ventura

Sometimes when a new OS drops, some hardware adoptions might be needed due to security features it provides. Ventura will drop support for a quite hefty portion of hardware compared to other versions.

You will need a device no older than 2017. For MacBook Air and Mini, push it to 2018. Mac Pro users, you need the cheesegrater. Time to throw my own trashbin in the... trashbin.

The list is the following: 
>
> - MacBook 2017 and later<br/>
> - MacBook Pro 2017 and later<br/>
> - iMac 2017 and later<br/>
> - iMac Pro 2017<br/>
> - MacBook Air 2018 and later<br/>
> - Mac Mini 2018 and later<br/>
> - Mac Pro 2019 and later<br/>
