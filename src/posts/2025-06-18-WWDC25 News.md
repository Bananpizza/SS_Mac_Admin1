# 📱 All the New MDM Features from Apple’s WWDC25

Apple's WWDC25 unveiled a massive slate of upgrades to Mobile Device Management (MDM), showcasing a vision centered around declarative management, automation, and streamlined identity. Here's a partial breakdown of everything new for IT administrators with Apple environments.

---

## 🔧 1. Apple Business & School Manager Gets Smarter

- **Managed Apple Accounts**: A new downloadable report lists personal Apple IDs linked to your domain, helping you steer users toward official managed accounts.
- **Block Personal Apple IDs**: IT can now block personal IDs during Setup Assistant—even without MDM configuration.
- **ABM/ASM APIs**: New APIs allow you to:
  - Retrieve device inventories
  - Reassign devices to different MDM servers
  - Check enrollment statuses
- **Vision Pro Enrollment Support**: Use Apple Configurator to enroll Vision Pro. Pairing via iPhone is now available.
- **Server Migration Tool**: Migrate devices between MDM servers without wiping them. Set migration deadlines with fallback auto-migration if users don’t act.
---

## 🛠 2. Declarative Device Management (DDM)

- **Expanded Support**: DDM now supports:
  - Software updates for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, visionOS
  - Vision Pro
- **New Update Controls**: Define update cadence, defer periods, and enforce deadlines—all handled on-device. Traditional commands are deprecated.

---

## 🌐 3. Safari & Network Management

- **Safari Configuration via DDM**:
  - Push bookmarks
  - Set default homepages
- **Managed Network Relays**: Now support FQDN-based traffic routing for more control over network traffic in enterprise setups.

---

## 🔁 4. Return to Service (Shared Devices)

- **Preserve Managed Apps**: Erase iPads, iPhones, or Vision Pro for reuse without wiping managed apps.
- **Vision Pro Support**: Control Center includes “Reset for Next User” to streamline shared use cases.

---

## 📦 5. Smarter App Management

- **Per‑App Deployment Controls**:
  - Pin versions
  - Block cellular downloads
  - Monitor install/update status
- **macOS App Distribution**:
  - Deploy apps/packages declaratively on macOS Tahoe
  - Create self-service catalogs with the new `ManagedAppDistribution` framework

---

## 🛂 6. Identity & Access Enhancements

- **Setup Assistant SSO**:
  - During ADE on macOS Tahoe, you can configure Platform SSO and link to Managed Apple ID **before** login.
- **Tap‑to‑Login / Authenticated Guest Mode**:
  - Use iPhone, Apple Watch, or NFC badge to unlock shared Macs.
  - All data is wiped after logout—ideal for labs and shift-based workers.

## 🔄 7. Migrating Devices to a New MDM Without Re-enrolling

For the first time, Apple lets you move devices between MDM servers without wiping or re-enrolling them. This is ideal during MDM vendor transitions or domain restructures and something I will personally test heavily when it is available. Will be very interesting to see how it work in practice.

### 🔑 Key Features:

- **No Factory Reset Required**: Devices retain all data and apps.
- **Deadline Control**: Set a grace period before automatic migration.
- **Cross‑platform Support**: Works across iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, and Vision Pro.
- **ABM/ASM Interface**: Reassignment done via Apple Business/School Manager.

### 🧭 Step-by-Step:

1. In ABM/ASM, navigate to **Devices > Assign to Server**
2. Select the new MDM server
3. Set the **migration window**
4. Devices will prompt users (or auto-migrate after the deadline)
