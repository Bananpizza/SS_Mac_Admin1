## Where are we heading?

This is a fresh blog about things related to macOS of things in the enterprise environment. I will try to add a bit on iPhones and iPads as well, don't be surprised if Android might appear when talking about phones specifically. 

I do have some posts in the making which I hope might help you out there manage your mac's in an easy way, or get some more knowledge. Some posts will be technical, some posts will be just pure information, thoughts and processes and some focusing on security.

## What to come

Some posts I have in the vault is;

- Review of the Apple event 7'th of September (if there is anything that's relevant)
- Single script Intune onboarding
- Microsoft Defender and macOS
- Apple sustainability and environment
- CIS Bench your macs in Intune
- Onboarding softwares
- Evaluation of the major endpoint management solutions


I hope some might interest you!
